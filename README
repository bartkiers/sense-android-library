 Introduction
===========================================================

The Sense PhoneGap plugins are designed to help web apps 
communicate with the native Sense Platform. You can find 
the repository for this project at:

https://dev.almende.com/svn/sense-phonegap

===========================================================
 Installation
===========================================================

Using this plugin requires Android PhoneGap. See: 

http://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-android. 

1. Make sure your project uses the Sense App Library 
project. This project enables the Sense plugin to use IPC 
to communicate with the Sense Platform, when it is 
installed.
 
The Library project code is available at:
 
https://dev.almende.com/svn/sense-platform

Create a separate Android Application for the Sense App 
Library, and use it as an Android Library Project. Careful: 
this is not the same as adding the project to your build 
path! See:

http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject

2. To install the plugins, copy sense_platform.js and 
ivitality.js to your project's www folder and include a 
reference to it in your html file after phonegap.js.

<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="phonegap-1.0.0.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="sense_platform.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="ivitality.js"></script>

3. Create a directory within your project called 
"src/nl/sense_os/phonegap/plugins" and copy 
SensePlugin.java, IVitalityPlugin.java, and 
InstallSenseDialog.java into it.

4. In your res/xml/plugins.xml file, add the following 
lines:

<plugin name="IVitalityPlugin" value="nl.sense_os.phonegap.plugins.IVitalityPlugin"/>
<plugin name="SensePlatform" value="nl.sense_os.phonegap.plugins.SensePlugin"/>

5. You can now reference the plugins from javascript using
window.plugins.sense.* and window.plugins.ivitality.*

===========================================================
 Examples
===========================================================

This project comes with examples of plugin usage. 

Copy the assets, src, and res folders to your Android 
project and follow the normal installation instructions. 
Launch ExampleApp to check out the example code. Make sure 
you take a look at the device's LogCat to see all activity.
